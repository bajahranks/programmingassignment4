This code book describes the variables, data and transformations made in this project.

## Summary

Variables representing mean and standard deviation was taken from the initial dataset. The dataset comprises of the merging of the test and train data sets. The initial data represented the activities in the form of an integer. That was transformed into a character vector for a clearer representation of the data. 

## Variables
